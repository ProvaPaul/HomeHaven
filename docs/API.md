# HomeHaven API Documentation

Base URL: `http://localhost:5000/api` (development) · `https://<your-render-app>.onrender.com/api` (production)

**Authentication** — JWT delivered as an httpOnly cookie on login/register. Clients may also send
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` (the token is included in login/register responses).
🔒 = requires authentication · 👑 = requires the `admin` role.

All responses follow `{ success: boolean, ...payload }`. Errors return
`{ success: false, message: string }` with an appropriate HTTP status.
